### üíª 2nd Year IT Student | Full-Stack Developer | Problem Solver

I‚Äôm currently pursuing my B.E. in Information Technology at PICT, Pune. My journey began with front-end web development, and as I‚Äôve grown, I‚Äôve expanded my skills to include back-end technologies, making me passionate about full-stack development. Alongside this, I‚Äôm also dedicated to improving my problem-solving skills through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
